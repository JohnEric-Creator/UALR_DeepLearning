He left his third-floor bedroom and began looking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped. This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out. They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel compound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the women did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all under 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building it shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors. Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling the air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than the tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air, driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks made. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to gather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle headed for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them. Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The FBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult members, in separate discussions with\n",

            "Bosnian Muslims are citizens od Bosnia-Herzegovina who identify themselves with Bosnian Muslim cultural and religious tradition. In Bosnia, \"Muslim\" is not merely a religious category, but an ethnic one as well. Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments made by people on this subject: (1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith. (2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel themselves to be Croats nor Serbs. In 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid, and (1) was soundly rejected. The reasons are pragmatic: even if Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality. In fact, although Bosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national allegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and historic identity. So, arguments like \"yes, but your ancestors were Croats or Serbs\" carry very little weight. Regardless of what their ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel that they are a separate national group, that ends the debate. What outsiders say is simply not relevant. In the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when \"Muslim nationality\" appeared as a census category for the first time. This was the result of a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing \"Bosniaks\" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H) declaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement of this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of \"Muslim nationality\" choice in census forms. For comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories available to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina: Serb-Muslims: 71,991 Croat-Muslims: 25,295 Muslims, ethnically undeclared: 788,403 This clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own nationality. Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat nationality\n",

Also, recall that the distribution of the 150lb is one five pound jaw+teeth operated by two 70lb muscles driven by a.005 ounce brain possessing an instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger. The other 5 lb is, of course, dog poop, but that varies all over the place as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended lawns of the dog's owner's neighbors (whilst continuously replenishing its inexhaustible supply, no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me). My very thought at the time, but as I looked down at these once formidable instruments of mayhem, I realized they had become weak and atrophied by too many sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically-correct CRT keyboard. There was only one option left: I reached down to the toolbox near my car and grasped my Craftsman 150 ft-lb torque wrench, surely the bludgeon of dire necessity if ever there was one. To my amazement and confusion, the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass, then leapt to its feet and vanished down the street, still quivering and occasionally looking back at me. \"Seven at One Blow!\" I exclaimed, flexing my new-found biceps and brandishing my Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked the now-secure environs of my domicile. It was only later that I found out what the dog apparently knew all along: the wrench was defective, would no longer measure torque accurately, and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it. What I had interpreted as fear and subservience were in fact unmitigated hilarity and contempt. Exactly: nobody can look quite as silly as we can.\n",

            "Let's be careful here. If players' performance was completely random in (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be good in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year. With two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each year, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year. We have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88). Just flipping a coin, you'd expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year. This is what we actually get-- No. of good years 0 1 2 3 4 5 Clutch performers 4 10 37 24 18 3 Coin flip (random) 3 15 30 30 15 3 Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process leading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random. If there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition) that had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping a coin. Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above or below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from the mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good. In the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years. Of those 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two years. In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and really horrible the other year. If it was just a random process, you'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5). Everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period of years that could be used to predict any ability with any proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage that could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein probably never had a \"clutch\" AB against a left-\n",

            "From article C68uBG.K2w@world.std.com>, by cfw@world.std.com (Christopher F Wroten): Good question. Answer: The EISA bus does move 32 bits rather than ISA's 8/(16?) But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus. I think that's either 8 or 10 mhz. The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA, but they move the data at the cpu speed, up to 40 mhz. So, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at 33 mhz, and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz. So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on a 33 mhz cpu. EISA should be about two (maybe 3) times as fast as ISA. That's a very good question. The EISA bus does have more advantages over the ISA bus than just it's width. For example: more/better interrupts and bus mastering. But these other factors do not impact a video card very much. They have more impact on file servers with multiple hard drives, full-throttle network cards, cd-roms, etc.\n",

        "**The following code block** is aimed at creating a bar chart of the top N words by frequency in a corpus. The first step is to join the input_texts into a single list of strings called corpus. Then, the CountVectorizer object from scikit-learn is created with English stop words to count the frequency of each word in the corpus. The top N words by frequency are then extracted and sorted in descending order using a lambda function. The words and freqs variables contain the top N words and their frequencies, respectively. A DataFrame object is created to store the top N words and their frequencies. Finally, a bar chart is created using Plotly Express library, where the x-axis corresponds to the words and the y-axis corresponds to their respective frequencies, with the chart title indicating the top N words in the corpus."
